This recipe integrates bacon, giving it a surf-and-turf feel that is a signature of contemporary Baja food.","instructions":"Warm 3 teaspoons of the oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.) Turn the heat to medium and add the chiles. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chiles are thoroughly cooked.<br>At this point, warm a separate frying pan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.<br>Once the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.<br>Sprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f3c25a27b7a251be6a4864b\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/BajaShrimpTacos_HERO_081220_10743_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/tacos-de-gobernador-shrimp-poblano-and-cheese","created_at":"2020-08-26T13:09:55.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T13:09:55.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":16,"recipe_id":2,"name":"4 teaspoons neutral cooking oil, such as canola oil","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":17,"recipe_id":2,"name":"1 onion, peeled and diced","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":18,"recipe_id":2,"name":"1 garlic clove, peeled and minced","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":19,"recipe_id":2,"name":"2 poblano chiles, stems removed, cut into 1\u20444-inch-wide strips","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":20,"recipe_id":2,"name":"8 corn tortillas","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":21,"recipe_id":2,"name":"Juice of 3 limes","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":22,"recipe_id":2,"name":"1 slice bacon, diced small","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":23,"recipe_id":2,"name":"8 ounces peeled and deveined medium shrimp (preferably sizes 36\/40 or 41\/50; if you have bigger shrimp, slice them in half lengthwise)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":24,"recipe_id":2,"name":"1 teaspoon kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":25,"recipe_id":2,"name":"1 cup Queso Asadero cheese (if not available, substitute Teleme or Monterey Jack)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":26,"recipe_id":2,"name":"2 limes, cut into wedges","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":27,"recipe_id":2,"name":"Homemade or store-bought tangy red salsa","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":2,"name":"David Castro Hussong","email":"davidcastrohussong@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/davidcastrohussong@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"}},{"id":3,"user_id":3,"name":"Kimchi Toast","description":"One of the many reasons you'll be grateful to have a jar of kimchi in your fridge at all times: this throw-together no-cook toast. \u00a0It's a low-lift breakfast, lunch, or snack that's ideal for even the laziest of days.","instructions":"Mix cream cheese and \u00be cup kimchi in a medium bowl.<br>Toss scallions and cilantro in a small bowl to combine.

The only real limit is your imagination.","instructions":"Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F. Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.<br>Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month.<br>Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 1\u00bd\" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you\u2019ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165\u00b0F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6\u20138 minutes.)<br>Using spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that\u2019s okay).<br>Starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving.<br>To slice, run a chef\u2019s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving.<br>Do Ahead: Pie can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f3fca40ff169fe5c93c6ae0\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/salted-pb&j-ice-cream-pie-recipe-BA-082120.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/salted-peanut-butter-jelly-pbj-ice-cream-pie","created_at":"2020-08-25T18:31:29.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T18:31:29.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":52,"recipe_id":6,"name":"1 sleeve (110 g) Ritz crackers or other cracker of your choice","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":53,"recipe_id":6,"name":"\u2153 cup (45 g) raw peanuts or other nut or seed, finely chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":54,"recipe_id":6,"name":"\u2153 cup (67 g; packed) light or dark brown sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z"},{"id":55,"recipe_id":6,"name":"\u00bd tsp.

For a good alternative, a swivel peeler (a straight one, as opposed to a Y-shaped one) or a corer both work very well.","instructions":"To make the sauce, put the oil into a saucepan or casserole pan with a lid\u2014about 10 inches\/25cm wide\u2014and place over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.<br>To make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1\u00bd tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.<br>Trim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin\u2014about\u00a0\u215b inch\/3mm away\u2014but not so close that it tears and won\u2019t hold its shape when it\u2019s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don\u2019t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife\u2014be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!<br>Use the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about\u00a0\u215b inch\/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about \u00bd inch\/1cm from the end intact\u2014they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.<br>Using your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about \u00bd inch\/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.<br>Gently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won\u2019t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft\u2014test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don\u2019t worry if some of the rice\/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.<br>To make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don\u2019t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside\u2014it will crisp up as it cools down\u2014and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.<br>When the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha\u2014the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic\u2014then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f3ae89315fb41021b8be77f\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/FalastinStuffedEggplant_RECIPE_081220_10670_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/stuffed-eggplants-and-zucchini-tomato-sauce-falastin","created_at":"2020-08-17T20:53:00.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T20:53:00.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":163,"recipe_id":15,"name":"2\u00bd

Stir, then drain through a colander, squeezing out most of the moisture from the bread. (If using grated zucchini, toss it with \u00bd tsp of salt and place in a sieve set over a bowl. Let to sit for 20 minutes, then use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.)<br>Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl with the chicken, garlic, spices, herbs, lemon zest, \u00be tsp salt, and plenty of black pepper. Using well-oiled hands, shape into about 30 small balls; roughly a scant 1 oz\/25g each.<br>Put 1 tbsp of oil into a large nonstick saut\u00e9 pan with a lid, and place over high heat. Once hot, add half the meatballs and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, turning throughout, until golden brown all over. Transfer the meatballs to a baking sheet and set aside. Keep the pan on the heat and continue with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and remaining meatballs in the same way.<br>Return the same pan to medium-high heat. Add the 2 garlic cloves, lemon rind, and stock and bring to a boil\u2014this should take about 3 minutes. Add the molokhieh (or the spinach and okra combination), cinnamon, 2 tsp of salt, and plenty of black pepper, then decrease the heat to medium and cook, covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the molokhieh is bubbling and completely defrosted. Add the meatballs, parsley, and \u00bd cup\/10g of cilantro and cook, covered, for another 10 minutes, or until completely cooked through. Stir in the lemon juice.<br>To make the adha, meanwhile, put the olive oil into a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until golden and crispy. Add the chile flakes, then remove from the heat and pour into a bowl. Stir in the cilantro and set aside.<br>Divide the soup among four bowls and top with the fried garlic and remaining \u00bd cup\/10g cilantro. Serve at once, with lemon wedges alongside.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f3ae8af5bfc53f0dae80547\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/ChickenMeatballsMolokhieh_RECIPE_081220_10690_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/chicken-meatballs-with-molokhieh-falastin","created_at":"2020-08-17T20:51:41.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T20:51:41.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":194,"recipe_id":16,"name":"1\u00be

Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about \u2154 cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using.<br>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.<br>Lightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.<br>Stir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.<br>Transfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.<br>Cut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.<br>Remove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you can\u2019t achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving.<br>To serve, run a knife or offset spatula around edge of pan to release. Unmold and remove parchment paper; discard. Transfer cake to a platter, smooth sides with an offset spatula, and freeze 10 minutes. Slice with a warm knife, wiping off between cuts.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f2323fb69a19aadba0fcb51\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/IceCreamCake_RECIPE_072220_9755_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/double-ripple-ice-cream-cake","created_at":"2020-08-11T18:10:27.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T18:10:27.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":303,"recipe_id":26,"name":"8 oz. red or black plums (2\u20133), pitted, chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":304,"recipe_id":26,"name":"3 Tbsp. light brown sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":305,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00bc tsp. kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":306,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00be cup (96 g) walnuts","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":307,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00bc cup (35 g) black and\/or white sesame seeds","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":308,"recipe_id":26,"name":"1 cup pure maple syrup, preferably grade B","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":309,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00bc tsp. kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":310,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for pan","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":311,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00be cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":312,"recipe_id":26,"name":"2 Tbsp. tahini","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":313,"recipe_id":26,"name":"2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":314,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00be tsp. kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":315,"recipe_id":26,"name":"1 chilled large egg","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":316,"recipe_id":26,"name":"1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":317,"recipe_id":26,"name":"\u00be tsp. baking powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":318,"recipe_id":26,"name":"5 pints high-quality vanilla ice cream, divided","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":319,"recipe_id":26,"name":"A 9\" springform pan","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":10,"name":"Tara O'Brady","email":"taraobrady@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/taraobrady@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"}},{"id":27,"user_id":8,"name":"Tiger Fruit Salad","description":"When that summer peach or plum isn\u2019t quite ripe enough to eat out of hand, marinate thin slices in a vinegary dressing for this refreshing riff on the Chinese dish lao hu cai.","instructions":"Gently toss fruit, chile, vinegar, sugar, and \u00bd tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine.

If you want something a little more substantial, add squid or shrimp cut into \u00a0bite-sized pieces.","instructions":"To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.<br>When you\u2019re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.<br>Set a 10-inch nonstick saut\u00e9 pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don\u2019t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200\u00b0F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it\u2019s best to eat them right away.<br>Cut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f2081a4f6b3d5f60a9b822b\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/korean-scallion-pancakes-pajeon-recipe-072820.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/scallion-pancakes-pajeon","created_at":"2020-08-05T04:00:00.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T04:00:00.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":372,"recipe_id":33,"name":"2 cups all-purpose flour","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":373,"recipe_id":33,"name":"\u00bd cup cornstarch","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":374,"recipe_id":33,"name":"2 teaspoons baking powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":375,"recipe_id":33,"name":"2 teaspoons sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":376,"recipe_id":33,"name":"1 teaspoon doenjang (Korean fermentedsoybean paste)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":377,"recipe_id":33,"name":"\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":378,"recipe_id":33,"name":"2 cups ice-cold club soda","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":379,"recipe_id":33,"name":"1 medium egg yolk","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":380,"recipe_id":33,"name":"2 teaspoons minced garlic","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":381,"recipe_id":33,"name":"3 bunches scallions, cut into 2-inch batons (if the scallions are thick, cut the white parts lengthwise in half before cutting into batons)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":382,"recipe_id":33,"name":"About 5 tablespoons grape seed or canola oil, for frying","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"},{"id":383,"recipe_id":33,"name":"Pajeon Sauce","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":21,"name":"Hooni Kim","email":"hoonikim@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/hoonikim@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:42.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"}},{"id":34,"user_id":21,"name":"Pajeon Sauce","description":"This bright, vinegary sauce is works wonderfully with all manner of panfried or deep-fried battered foods, including scallion pancakes and dumplings.","instructions":"Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

Use fresh produce like cauliflower, carrots, radish, radish pods, or raw turmeric for this preparation.","instructions":"Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling.\nTo prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.<br>If using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.<br>Method: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.<br>To Store: Use smaller (4 \u2013 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge.\nThe pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f29bc54f689bab939e9a617\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/CauliflowerCarrotAchaar_RECIPE_072220_9848_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/shaak-no-sambharo-quick-pickled-vegetables","created_at":"2020-08-04T20:57:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T20:57:46.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":392,"recipe_id":35,"name":"\u2153 cup vegetable oil","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":393,"recipe_id":35,"name":"4 Tbsp. whole black mustard seeds (or 4 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed mustard seeds)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":394,"recipe_id":35,"name":"3 Tbsp. whole fenugreek seeds (or 3 Tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed fenugreek)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":395,"recipe_id":35,"name":"1 tsp. asafetida powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":396,"recipe_id":35,"name":"1 Tbsp. ground cayenne (to taste) or 1 large serrano pepper, deseeded, and sliced thin","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":397,"recipe_id":35,"name":"\u2153 cup julienned ginger (optional, see Pre-Prep below)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":398,"recipe_id":35,"name":"2-4 Tbsp. white vinegar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":399,"recipe_id":35,"name":"2 tsp. kosher salt (optional)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"},{"id":400,"recipe_id":35,"name":"2 cups mixed vegetables, prepped as follows","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":22,"name":"Nandita Godbole","email":"nanditagodbole@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/nanditagodbole@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:43.000000Z"}},{"id":36,"user_id":22,"name":"Gol-Keri (Quick Mango Achaar)","description":"This mango achaar is of our favorite ways to eat tart mangoes in the summer.

Here, green tomatoes not yet ripe enough to eat are transformed into a bright pickled expression of the first days of summer. It has been said that chowchow began as a collection of remnant produce that couldn\u2019t be used in other dishes, so it became its own reclaimed relish. As you chop each vegetable, consider that origin: making the most from the least, creating abundance from scarcity. You can use four heatproof glass pint jars for this, though I prefer eight 8-ounce jars instead so I can share it around. Using pickling salt, such as Morton Canning & Pickling Salt, helps the liquid stay clear and keeps the cabbage from turning brown.","instructions":"Toss cabbage, green tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, and salt in a large bowl until all of the vegetables are coated in salt (this will help them release some water). Cover and chill at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Drain vegetables.<br>Toast mustard seeds in a large pot over medium-high heat, shaking pan, until fragrant and slightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add both vinegars, sugar, mustard, and turmeric. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.<br>Add garlic and drained vegetables to pickling liquid and mix well. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil; cook 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have melded and liquid is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. The cabbage and green tomatoes should still have a bit of a crunch. Let cool (this will take about 1 hour).<br>Using a slotted spoon, divide chowchow among sterilized glass jars of choice and spoon pickling liquid over (chowchow should be submerged and there should be about \u00bd\" space at the top of each jar. Cover and chill.<br>Do ahead: Chowchow can be made 1 month ahead. Keep chilled. If you\u2019d like to keep it longer, you can use the water bath boiling technique to make the jarred chowchow shelf stable.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5f19a4705dbd008b1a5f8ea6\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/ChowChow_Recipe_v2_071520_9281_VOG_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/chowchow","created_at":"2020-07-27T16:57:57.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T16:57:57.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":540,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 small green cabbage (about 2 lb.), chopped into \u00bd\" pieces (about 10 cups)2 large green tomatoes, cut into \u00bd\" pieces","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":541,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 large sweet onion, cut into \u00bd\" pieces","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":542,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 large green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, cut into \u00bd\" pieces","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":543,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 large red bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, cut into \u00bd\" pieces","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":544,"recipe_id":50,"name":"2 Tbsp. pickling salt or 3 Tbsp. kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":545,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 Tbsp. yellow mustard seeds","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":546,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1\u00bd cups apple cider vinegar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":547,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1\u00bd cups distilled white vinegar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":548,"recipe_id":50,"name":"2 cups cane sugar (such as Wholesome) or raw sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":549,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 Tbsp. yellow mustard","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":550,"recipe_id":50,"name":"1 tsp. ground turmeric","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"},{"id":551,"recipe_id":50,"name":"2 garlic cloves, finely chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":27,"name":"Jocelyn Jackson","email":"jocelynjackson@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/jocelynjackson@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z"}},{"id":51,"user_id":28,"name":"Creole Caesar Salad With Corn Bread Croutons","description":"This Caesar salad works in flavors from the African American kitchens in the Lowcountry.

Indoor temperatures were about 68\u00b0F\u201472\u00b0F when we developed this recipe and that\u2019s what our time range reflects, so use it just as a guideline. If possible, 82\u00b0F is ideal. Most important though will be checking for signs that indicate the batter is ready (bubbly, airy, and sour).","instructions":"The morning before you make your batter, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold running water, until water runs almost clear. Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.<br>Pick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.<br>Drain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then pur\u00e9e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.<br>Add reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4\u20136 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.<br>Do ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.<br>Heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7\u20139 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.<br>Wipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.<br>To cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you\u2019re good to go. (It\u2019s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it\u2019s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it\u2019s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous \u2153-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8\"-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle \u215b tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.<br>Serve dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5ed15d63b04a09f415db838b\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/EPI-Dosa-HERO.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/homestyle-dosas-with-tomato-chutney","created_at":"2020-07-15T17:06:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T17:06:30.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":606,"recipe_id":54,"name":"2 cups long-grain white rice","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":607,"recipe_id":54,"name":"\u00bd cup whole or split urad dal (black gram)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":608,"recipe_id":54,"name":"\u00bd tsp. fenugreek seeds","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":609,"recipe_id":54,"name":"1 tsp. kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":610,"recipe_id":54,"name":"2 tsp. plus 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":611,"recipe_id":54,"name":"1 small onion, finely chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":612,"recipe_id":54,"name":"2\u20133 small green chiles (such as serrano), seeds removed if desired, finely chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":613,"recipe_id":54,"name":"4 small tomatoes or canned whole peeled tomatoes, chopped","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":614,"recipe_id":54,"name":"Kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":615,"recipe_id":54,"name":"2 tsp. black mustard seeds","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":616,"recipe_id":54,"name":"8\u201310 fresh or frozen curry leaves","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":617,"recipe_id":54,"name":"1 dried red chile (such as bird or chile de \u00e1rbol)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":618,"recipe_id":54,"name":"1 tsp. split or whole urad dal (black gram)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":619,"recipe_id":54,"name":"A pinch of asafoetida (optional)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"},{"id":620,"recipe_id":54,"name":"1 tsp. ghee or clarified butter, melted, divided, plus more for griddle","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":10,"name":"Tara O'Brady","email":"taraobrady@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/taraobrady@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:40.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:45.000000Z"}},{"id":55,"user_id":31,"name":"Shimbra Wat","description":"This Ethiopian dish of chickpeas in a berbere-spiced, flaxseed-thickened sauce makes for a quick, filling, and wonderfully flavorful meal.","instructions":"Heat a small dry frying pan over medium-low heat.

Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Set aside for serving.<br>Blend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and \u2153 cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1\u20132 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny.

Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.<br>Whisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.<br>Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret  side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it\u2019s done), 10\u201315 minutes. (And if you don\u2019t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above.

Set aside.<br>With a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)<br>Spread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.<br>Fire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need\na low temperature of around 250 to 300\u00b0F (120 to 150\u00b0C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.<br>Drain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.<br>Place the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300\u00b0F (120 and 150\u00b0C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.<br>Once the ribs are on, it\u2019s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don\u2019t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5eeb930c9d97ae4950cc7167\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/Utility_Baby_Back_Ribs_1_final.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/hickory-smoked-baby-back-ribs-rob-rainford","created_at":"2020-06-18T17:32:38.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T17:32:38.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":717,"recipe_id":69,"name":"5 Tbsp (75 mL) packed brown sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":718,"recipe_id":69,"name":"3 Tbsp (45 mL) kosher salt","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":719,"recipe_id":69,"name":"2 Tbsp (30 mL) sweet smoked paprika 4 tsp (20 mL) ancho chili powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":720,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 Tbsp (15 mL) paprika","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":721,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 Tbsp (15 mL) onion powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":722,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 Tbsp (15 mL) freshly cracked black pepper 2 tsp (10 mL) dried thyme leaves","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":723,"recipe_id":69,"name":"6 racks baby back ribs, about 6 lb (2.7 kg)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":724,"recipe_id":69,"name":"4 medium chunks hickory wood, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a charcoal grill) or 4 cups (1 L) hickory wood chips, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a gas grill)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":725,"recipe_id":69,"name":"3\u20444 cup (185 mL) apple cider","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":726,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1\u20442 cup (125 mL) ketchup","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":727,"recipe_id":69,"name":"3 Tbsp (45 mL) red wine vinegar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":728,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 Tbsp (15 mL) Dijon mustard","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":729,"recipe_id":69,"name":"2 tsp (10 mL) light soy sauce","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":730,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 tsp (5 mL) Worcestershire sauce","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":731,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1 tsp (5 mL) molasses","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":732,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) ancho chili powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":733,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) ground cumin","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":734,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1\u20442 tsp (2 mL) minced garlic","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"},{"id":735,"recipe_id":69,"name":"1\u20444 tsp (1 mL) freshly ground black pepper","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":42,"name":"Rob Rainford","email":"robrainford@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/robrainford@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:46.000000Z"}},{"id":70,"user_id":43,"name":"Grilled Watermelon Salad With Lime Mango Dressing","description":"Grilling watermelon caramelizes the sweetness of the fruit, and the char gives just a hint of smoky flavor.","instructions":"Put all of the ingredients except the oil in a blender.

Garnish each serving with cilantro and serve immediately.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5eea33f755507f518cb376ec\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/frogmore-stew-recipe-061720.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/frogmore-stew","created_at":"2020-06-17T15:31:45.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T15:31:45.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":838,"recipe_id":78,"name":"12 to 14 cups water, fish stock, or seafood stock","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":839,"recipe_id":78,"name":"4 bay leaves","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":840,"recipe_id":78,"name":"\u00bc cup plus 2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":841,"recipe_id":78,"name":"1 cup chopped celery","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":842,"recipe_id":78,"name":"1 cup chopped onions","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":843,"recipe_id":78,"name":"\u00bd cup whole peeled garlic cloves","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":844,"recipe_id":78,"name":"3 whole bird\u2019s-eye chiles","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":845,"recipe_id":78,"name":"1 pound small red potatoes, scrubbed, or 6 purple yams, cut into 2-inch chunks","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":846,"recipe_id":78,"name":"1 pound smoked hot sausage links or chicken sage sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":847,"recipe_id":78,"name":"6 ears corn, shucked and quartered","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":848,"recipe_id":78,"name":"2 pounds shell-on large shrimp","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":849,"recipe_id":78,"name":"2 pounds shelled scallops","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":850,"recipe_id":78,"name":"1 cup dry white wine","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":851,"recipe_id":78,"name":"Salt and pepper","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":852,"recipe_id":78,"name":"Coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":28,"name":"Alexander Smalls","email":"alexandersmalls@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/alexandersmalls@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:44.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}},{"id":79,"user_id":48,"name":"Very Red Velvet Cake","description":"No cocoa means this red velvet cake is a vibrant magenta. To finish: a classic cream cheese frosting and a scattering of chopped pecans.","instructions":"To make the cake: Set the oven to 350\u00b0F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray.<br>Sift the flour with the baking soda.<br>In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar. On low speed, slowly add the flour and beat in well. Add the buttermilk slowly, then the vanilla, and then the food coloring.<br>Pour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.<br>Run a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they\u2019re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.<br>To make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth. It\u2019s best to use the icing right away, when it\u2019s soft and spreadable.<br>Put one cake layer upside down on a cake plate or cake stand and cover the top evenly with frosting. Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake.<br>Once the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve. This cake keeps for up to 2 weeks in a cake keeper, but once it\u2019s ready, people want to dive right in.","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5ee946ae7d03c0d60a62c025\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/red-velvet-cake-slices-recipe-061620.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/very-red-velvet-cake-with-cream-cheese-icing-and-pecans","created_at":"2020-06-16T22:27:51.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T22:27:51.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":853,"recipe_id":79,"name":"2\u00bd cups cake flour","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":854,"recipe_id":79,"name":"\u00bd teaspoon baking soda","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":855,"recipe_id":79,"name":"2 large eggs, at room temperature","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":856,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1\u00bd cups sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":857,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1\u00bd cups vegetable oil","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":858,"recipe_id":79,"name":"2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":859,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 cup buttermilk","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":860,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":861,"recipe_id":79,"name":"3 tablespoons red food coloring (from two 1-ounce bottles)","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":862,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 (1-pound) box confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":863,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":864,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, softened","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":865,"recipe_id":79,"name":"1 cup chopped pecans","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":48,"name":"Dora Charles","email":"doracharles@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/doracharles@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}},{"id":80,"user_id":49,"name":"Strawberry Balsamic Shortcakes","description":"This is my tangy updo to the sinfully sweet strawberry shortcake.","instructions":"To make the strawberries, toss the coined berries and cane sugar together in a bowl.

Add the butter and pulse a few more times until the mixture is coarse but the butter pieces are still visible. Slowly add the ice water and pulse to form a dough, six to eight pulses. If the dough looks and feels very dry, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in half and wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap; flatten each piece into a disc. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.<br>Make the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the peaches, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.<br>Preheat the oven to 375\u00baF.<br>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and cut in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 9 x 13-inch rectangle, about \u00bc inch thick. Set aside and repeat with the second piece of dough.<br>Line a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with one of the dough rectangles, pressing any excess dough against the sides of the dish. Pour in the peach filling and spread it evenly. Place the second rectangle of dough on top of the peaches and tuck the excess dough into corners.

Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it\u2019s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.<br>To make the pur\u00e9e, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to use it.<br>To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn\u2019t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.<br>Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don\u2019t panic\u2014this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1\/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.<br>Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don\u2019t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it\u2019s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry pur\u00e9e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.<br>Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I\u2019ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).","thumbnail":"https:\/\/assets.epicurious.com\/photos\/5ee933c92b15ed56ed38d21b\/6:4\/w_480,h_320,c_limit\/elderflower-and-roasted-strawberry-layer-cake-recipe-061620.jpg","uri":"https:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/roasted-strawberry-layer-cake-new-way-to-cake","created_at":"2020-06-15T21:15:00.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T21:15:00.000000Z","ingredients":[{"id":989,"recipe_id":90,"name":"Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":990,"recipe_id":90,"name":"2\u00bd tsp (11 g) baking powder","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":991,"recipe_id":90,"name":"3 tbsp (45 ml) milk","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":992,"recipe_id":90,"name":"2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":993,"recipe_id":90,"name":"1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":994,"recipe_id":90,"name":"1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine\/caster sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":995,"recipe_id":90,"name":"Zest of 1 lemon","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":996,"recipe_id":90,"name":"4 eggs","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":997,"recipe_id":90,"name":"Approximately 1 lb (400\u2013450 g) fresh strawberries","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":998,"recipe_id":90,"name":"\u00bc cup (50 g) superfine\/caster sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":999,"recipe_id":90,"name":"2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1000,"recipe_id":90,"name":"\u00bd cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1001,"recipe_id":90,"name":"1 cup (200 g) superfine\/caster sugar","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1002,"recipe_id":90,"name":"1\u2153 cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1003,"recipe_id":90,"name":"6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1004,"recipe_id":90,"name":"Fresh strawberries, to decorate","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"},{"id":1005,"recipe_id":90,"name":"Fresh elderflower, to decorate","quantity":null,"unit":null,"created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}],"author":{"id":56,"name":"Benjamina Ebuehi","email":"benjaminaebuehi@epicurious.com","email_verified_at":null,"avatar":"https:\/\/api.adorable.io\/avatars\/285\/benjaminaebuehi@epicurious.com.png","created_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T12:13:48.000000Z"}}]
